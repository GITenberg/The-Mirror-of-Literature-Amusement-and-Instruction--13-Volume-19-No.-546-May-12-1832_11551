<h2>ST. PANCRAS (OLD) CHURCH.</h2>
<div class="figure" style="width:80%;"><a href=

"" /></a> ST. PANCRAS (OLD) CHURCH.</div>
<p>This humble village fane is situated to the north of London,
somewhat more than a mile from Holborn Bars. Persons unacquainted
with the site, may hitherto have considered it as part and parcel
of this vast metropolis: but, lo! here it stands amidst much of its
primitive, peaceful rusticity.</p>
<p>Pancras is still, by courtesy, called a <i>village</i>, though
its charms may be of the <i>rus-in-urbe</i> description. It derives
its name from the saint to whom the church is dedicated:<a id=
"footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> it was called St. Pancras when the
Survey of Domesday was taken. The parish is of great extent. Mr.
Lysons states it at 2,700 acres of land, including the site of
buildings. It is bounded on the north by Islington, Hornsey, and
Finchley; and on the west by Hampstead and Marybone. On the south
it meets the parishes of St. Giles's in the Fields, St. George the
Martyr, St. George, Bloomsbury, and St. Andrew's, Holborn.<a id=
"footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
"#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> On the east it is bounded by St.
James's, Clerkenwell. Kentish Town, part of Highgate, Camden Town,
and Somer's Town,<a id="footnotetag3" name=
"footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> are
comprised within this parish as hamlets. Mr. Lysons supposes it to
have included the prebendal manor of Kentish Town,<a id=
"footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href=
"#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> or Cantelows, which now constitutes a
stall in St. Paul's Cathedral. Among the prebendaries have been men
eminent for their learning and piety: as Lancelot Andrews, bishop
of Winchester, Dr. Sherlock, Archdeacon Paley, and the Rev. William
Beloe, B.D. well known by his translation of Herodotus.</p>
<p>It would occupy too much space to detail the progressive
increase of this district. When a visitation of the church
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>[pg
290]</span> was made in the year 1251, there were only forty houses
in the parish. The desolate situation of the village in the latter
part of the sixteenth century is emphatically described by Norden,
in his <i>Speculum Britanni&aelig;</i>. After noticing the solitary
condition of the church, he says, "yet about this structure have
bin manie buildings now decaied, leaving poore Pancras without
companie or comfort." In some manuscription additions to his work,
the same writer has the following observations:&mdash;"Although
this place be, as it were, forsaken of all; and true men seldom
frequent the same, but upon devyne occasions; yet it is visyted by
thieves, who assemble there not to pray, but to wait for praye; and
manie fell into their handes, clothed, that are glad when they are
escaped naked. Walk not there too late." Newcourt, whose work was
published in 1700, says that houses had been built near the church.
The first important increase of the parish took place in the
neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road.</p>
<p>"Pancras Church," says Norden, "standeth all alone, as utterly
forsaken, old and wether-beten, which, for the antiquity thereof,
it is thought not to yield to Paules in London." It is of rude
Gothic architecture, built of stones and flints, which are now
covered with plaster. Mr. Lysons says, "It is certainly not older
than the fourteenth century, perhaps in Norden's time it had the
appearance of great decay; the same building, nevertheless,
repaired from time to time, still remains; looks no longer 'old and
wether-beten,' and may still exist perhaps to be spoken of by some
antiquary of a future century. It is a very small structure,
consisting only of a nave and chancel; at the west end is a low
tower, with a kind of dome."<a id="footnotetag5" name=
"footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> Mr. Lysons
speaks of the disproportionate size of the church to the population
of the parish; but since his time another church has been erected,
the splendour and size of which in every respect accord with the
increased wealth and numbers of the parish.</p>
<p>The church and churchyard of Pancras have long been noted as the
burial-place of such Roman Catholics as die in London and its
vicinity.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href=
"#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> Many of the tombs exhibit a cross,
and the initials R.I.P. (<i>Requiescat in pace</i>), which
initials, or others analogous to them, are always used by the
Catholics on their sepulchral monuments. Mr. Lysons heard it
assigned by some of that persuasion, as a reason for this
preference to Pancras as a burial-place, that masses were formerly
said in a church in the south of France, dedicated to the same
saint, for the souls of the deceased interred at St. Pancras in
England. After the French revolution, a great number of
ecclesiastics and other refugees, some of them of high rank, were
buried in this churchyard; and in 1811, Mr. Lysons observed that
probably about 30 of the French clergy had on an average been
buried at Pancras for some years past: in 1801 there were 41, and
in 1802, 32. Mr. Lysons's explanation of this preference to Pancras
by the Catholics is, however, disputed by the author of
<i>Ecclesiastical Topography</i>, who observes that a reason more
generally given is, that "Pancras was the last church in England
where mass was performed after the Reformation."</p>
<p>In the chancel are monuments of Daniel Clarke, Esq. who had been
master-cook to Queen Elizabeth; and of Cooper the artist, whose
style approached so near to that of Vandyke, that he has been
called Vandyke in miniature: he taught the author of Hudibras to
paint; his wife was sister to Pope's mother.</p>
<p>In the churchyard are the tombs of Anthony Woodhead, 1678, who
was in his day, the great champion of the Roman Catholic religion,
and was reputed to have written the Whole Duty of Man; Lady
Slingsby, whose name occurs as an actress in Dryden and Lee's
plays, from 1681 to 1689; Jeremy Collier, 1726, the pertinacious
non-juror, who repressed the immoralities of the stage; Ned Ward,
author of the London Spy, 1731; Leoni, the architect, 1746; Lady
Henrietta, wife of Beard, the vocalist, 1753; Van Bleeck, the
portrait-painter; Ravenet, the engraver, 1764; Mazzinghi, 1775,
leader of the band at Marylebone Gardens, and father of Mazzinghi,
the celebrated composer; Henry and Robert Rackett, Pope's nephews;
Woollett, the engraver, 1785, to whose memory a monument has been
placed in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey; Baron de Wenzel, the
celebrated oculist, 1790; Mary Wollestonecraft Godwin, author of a
Vindication of the Rights of Woman, 1797; the Rev. Arthur O'Leary,
or Father O'Leary, the amiable Franciscan friar, 1802; Paoli, the
patriotic Corsican, 1807; Walker editor of the Pronouncing
Dictionary; the Chevalier d'Eon, 1810, of epicene notoriety; and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>[pg
291]</span> Packer, the comedian, 1806, who is said to have
performed 4,852 times, besides walking in processions; Edwards,
professor of Perspective, 1806; Scheemakers, the statuary,
1808.</p>
<p>In the <i>Beauties of England and Wales</i>, it is stated that
23 acres of land belong to the church; and the great increase of
buildings renders these of considerable value; though it is not
known to whom the church is indebted for this possession.</p>

<h3>CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLES.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>These remains of ancient art are destined to be removed to
Europe.<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href=
"#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> The palace of Cleopatra was built
upon the walls facing the port of Alexandria, Egypt, having a
gallery on the outside, supported by several fine columns. Towards
the eastern part of the palace are two obelisks, vulgarly called
<i>Cleopatra's Needles</i>. They are of Thebaic stone, and covered
with hieroglyphics; one is overturned, broken, and lying under the
sand; the other is on its pedestal. These two obelisks, each of
them of a single stone, are about sixty feet high, by seven feet
square at the base. The Egyptian priests called these obelisks the
sun's fingers, because they served as stiles or gnomons to mark the
hours on the ground. In the first ages of the world they were made
use of to transmit to posterity the principal precepts of
philosophy, which were engraven on them in hieroglyphics.</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>"Between the statues, <i>Obelisks</i> were placed:</p>
<p>And the learned walls with <i>hieroglyphics</i> grac'd.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In after ages they were used to immortalize the actions of
heroes, and the memory of persons beloved.</p>
<p>The first obelisk we know of was that raised by Rameses, King of
Egypt, in the time of the Trojan war. Augustus erected an obelisk
at Rome, in the Campus Martius, which served to mark the hours on
an horizontal dial, drawn on the pavement. This obelisk was brought
from Egypt, and was said to have been formed by Sesostris, near a
thousand years before Christ. It was used by Manlius for the same
purpose for which it was originally destined, namely, to measure
the height of the sun.</p>

<h3>TRAITS OF IRISH CHARACTER.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>A gentleman residing in the vicinity of Dublin, found,
notwithstanding the protection of a thick, and thorny hedge, that
great depredations were committed on his garden and paddocks; so he
inclosed them with a high, strong wall. As he kept cows, and had
more milk than was sufficient for his family, he distributed the
overplus amongst his poor neighbours. One day, inspecting in
person, this distribution, he saw a woman attending with her pails,
who, he was tolerably certain did not require such assistance.
"You, here! my good friend," said he, "I thought you kept a
cow?"</p>
<p>"Ay, plase yer honour's honour, and <i>two</i> it was that I
<i>once</i> kept, the craters!"</p>
<p>"<i>Once</i>, why don't you keep them now?"</p>
<p>"Ough! 'tis yeaself must answer that question, for why? the
bastes did <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name=
"page292"></a>[pg 292]</span> well enough afore your rav'rence run
up that bit o' wall round your fields, seein' the cows lived off
your grass; but sorra for me now, I've sold 'em both, by rason I
couldn't <i>keep</i> 'em no longer."</p>
<p>An English gentleman, on a tour in Ireland, was beset at a fine
waterfall by numerous beggars; one woman was particularly clamorous
for relief, but Mr. R. instructed by his guide, said to her, "My
good friend, you cannot possibly want relief, as you keep several
cows, and have a very profitable farm; indeed I cannot bestow my
charity upon you." The woman, looking sulky, and <i>detected</i>,
immediately pointed to another, exclaiming, "Then give to
<i>her</i>, for she's got <i>nothing</i>!" The stranger in Dublin
is particularly requested to send all beggars to an institution in
Copper Alley, for their relief. Being once much importuned by an
old man for money, we desired him to go to this place. "I can't,"
said he.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Becase 'tis a bad place for the poor."</p>
<p>"How so? don't they give you anything to eat?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, yes, but the thing is, my jewel, they wont by no manes
give a poor body <i>anything to drink</i>." The intelligent reader
will not be at a loss to translate the complaint of thirsty
Pat.</p>
<hr />
<h3>FRENCH CRUELTY.</h3>
<p>During the late French Revolution, one of the royalist soldiers
having his horse shot under him by a pupil of the Polytechnic
School, and finding when thus brought down, that he could not
regain his feet and resume a posture of defence, but was entirely
at the mercy of his ferocious young adversary, he immediately
surrendered his sword, exclaiming, "I am your prisoner, and entreat
of you mercy and life." To which the <i>generous</i> and
<i>heroic</i> youth replied, "No prisoners, no mercy!" and taking
from his pocket a pike-head or some similar rough weapon,
deliberately drove it into the unfortunate soldier's heart!</p>
<hr />
<h3>EFFRONTERY.</h3>
<p>A nobleman being, it is said, some years since, in the shop of a
celebrated London shoemaker, saw, pass through it, a very handsome
young woman, "Who is that fine girl?" said he.</p>
<p>"My daughter," replied the <i>cord-wainer</i>, "with sixty
thousand pounds at your lordship's service."</p>
<hr />
<h3>A BLUNDER.</h3>
<p>Literary topics came under discussion one evening in a small
social circle, of which the writer made one, and particularly the
autobiographical works, and personal memoirs, now so much in vogue.
A gentleman then stated, that having seen much of the world, he
thought he must follow the fashion, and one day favour it with his
own life and adventures. Numerous ladies were to figure in his
book, which was, in fact, as he modestly gave the present company
to understand, to be a complete chronicle of the flirtations and
conquests of himself, and male allies, with letters, portraits,
&amp;c. and <i>names</i> in full. "But," remarked a lady, humouring
the jest, "if you <i>do</i> render your book so very personal, are
you not afraid of the consequences?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," replied the embryo author very gravely, "for
though I shall enjoy the remarks of the world, upon my
<i>autobiography</i>, they cannot affect me, as it will of course
be a <i>posthumous work</i>."</p>
<hr />
<h3>COOL COURAGE.</h3>
<p>During the disastrous fire of the Kent East Indiaman, a lady on
board exhibited a very singular instance of <i>sang froid</i> and
presence of mind. Being in one of the cabins, with a large,
helpless, despairing, and of course, most troublesome party,
chiefly of her own sex, "all hands" of the other being "turned up,"
we presume, to check the advances of the devouring element, she
proposed, by way of keeping them quiet, <i>to make tea for
them</i>, and we believe her proposal was accepted, and had the
desired effect.</p>

<h3>ABSTRACT STUDIES.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>
<p>Demosthenes to be the more removed from noise, and less subject
to distraction, caused a small chamber to be made under ground, in
which he shut himself up sometimes for whole months, shaving half
his head and only half his face, that he might not be in a
condition to go abroad. It was there, by the light of a small lamp,
he composed his admirable Orations, which were said by those who
envied him, to smell of the oil, to imply that they were too
elaborate. He rose very early, and used to say, that he was sorry
when any workman was at his business before him. He copied
Thucydides' history eight times with his own hand, in order to
render the style of that great man familiar to him.</p>
<p>Adrian Turnebus, a French critic, was so indefatigable in his
study, that it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name=
"page293"></a>[pg 293]</span> was said of him, as it was of
Budaeus, that he spent some hours in study even on the day he was
married.</p>
<p>Frederick Morel had so strong an attachment to study, that when
he was informed of his wife's being at the point of death, he would
not lay down his pen, till he had finished what he was upon, and
when she was dead, as she was before they could prevail on him to
stir, he was only heard to reply coldly, "I am very sorry, she was
a good woman."</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton, when he had any mathematical problems or
solutions in his mind, would never quit the subject on any account;
dinner was often known to be three hours ready for him before he
could be brought to table. His man often said, when he was getting
up in the morning, and began to dress, he would, with one leg in
his breeches, sit down again on the bed, and remain there for hours
before he got his clothes on.</p>
<p>Mr. Abraham Sharp, the astronomer, through his love of study,
was very irregular as to his meals, which he frequently took in the
following manner: a little square hole, something like a window,
made a communication between the room where he usually studied, and
another chamber in the house, where a servant could enter, and
before this hole he had contrived a sliding board, the servant
always placing his victuals in the hole, without speaking a word or
making the least noise, and when he had leisure he visited it to
see what it contained, and to satisfy his hunger or thirst. But it
often happened that the breakfast, the dinner, and the supper
remained untouched by him, so deeply was he engaged in his
calculations and solemn musings. At one time after his provisions
had been neglected for a long season, his family became uneasy, and
resolved to break in upon his retirement; he complained, but with
great mildness, that they had disconcerted his thoughts in a chain
of calculations which had cost him intense application for three
days successively. On an old oak table, where for a long course of
years he used to write, cavities might easily be perceived, worn by
the perpetual rubbing of his arms and elbows.<a id="footnotetag8"

<h2>THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF <i>NEW WORKS</i>.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>THE CONTRAST.</h3>
<p>The title of Lord Mulgrave's clever novel is sufficiently
explained by the hero, Lord Castleton, a man of high refinement,
marrying an unsophisticated, uneducated peasant girl. The scenes
and incidents of her introduction into the fashionable world are
replete with humour, yet true to the life. Thus, how naturally are
her new Ladyship's embarrassments told:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There were some points on which she would even have endeavoured
to extract knowledge from the servants; but dreading, from her
former habits, nothing so much as too great a familiarity in this
respect, Castleton had made it one of his first desires to her,
that she would confine her communications with them, to asking for
what she wanted. To this, as to every other desire of his, she
yielded, as far as she could, implicit obedience; but it was often
a great exertion on her part to do so. Of her own maid she had felt
from the first a considerable awe; and to such a degree did this
continue, that she could not conceive any fatigue from labour equal
to the burthen of her assistance. Being naturally of a disposition
both active and obliging, it was quite new to her to have any thing
done for her which she could do for herself. For some time she had
as great a horror of touching a bell-rope, as others have in
touching the string of a shower-bath; and when services were
obtruded on her by the domestics as a matter of course, she had
much difficulty in checking the exuberance of her gratitude.</p>
<p>"At home, Big Betsey, mentioned before as the maid of all work,
never considered as any part of her multitudinous duties the
waiting on Miss Lucy, who she not only said 'mought moind herself,'
but sometimes called to her, almost authoritatively, 'to lend a
hauping haund.' It was, probably, in consequence of the habit thus
engendered, that Lady Castleton was one day caught 'lending a
helping hand' to an over-loaded under laundry-maid, who had been
sent by her superior with a wicker-bound snowy freight of her
Ladyship's own superfine linen. But of all the irksome feelings
caused by Lucy's new position, there was none from which she
suffered more, than <i>waiting</i> to be <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span>
<i>waited on</i>. And it was hinted in the hall, that when my Lord
was not in the room, my Lady got up to help herself to what she
wanted from the sideboard!! And it was whispered in the female
conclave of the housekeeper's room, that her Lady-ship seemed even
to like to&mdash;lace her own stays!!"</p>
<p>Again, after Lady Castleton receiving a visit from a ton-ish
family, his Lordship asks:&mdash;</p>
<p>And did they make many inquiries of you? ask many
questions?"</p>
<p>"Oh, such a many!"</p>
<p>"So many, dearest love, you mean to say."</p>
<p>"Well, so I do, thank you; and then the mamma asked me, as she
had never seen me before, if I had not been much abroad; and I
said, never at all till I married; and then she said, 'What! had I
been to Paris since?' and I find she meant foreign parts by abroad.
And she told me that we ought to go to London soon; that the season
was advanced, and that the Pasta would come out soon this spring.
What is the Pasta&mdash;a plant?"</p>
<p>"A plant! no, love. Pasta is a singer's name, you could not be
expected to know that; but I hope you didn't say any thing to show
them your ignorance?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no; you told me, whenever I was completely puzzled, that
silence was best; so I said nothing. Pasta's the name of a singer,
then! Oh, that accounts, for a moment after she the mamma said,
that her daughter Arabella sang delightfully, and asked me if I
would sing with her; so I said no, I'd much rather listen. That was
right, warn't it? You see I knew you'd ask me all about it, so I
recollected it for you. Arabella then asked me if I would accompany
her? so I said, Wherever she liked,&mdash;where did she want to go?
But, I suppose, she altered her mind, for she sat down to the grand
instrument you had brought here for me to begin my lessons upon;
and then she sang such an extraordinary song&mdash;all coming from
her throat. And the sister asked me if I understood German? and I
answered, No, nor French neither."</p>
<p>"That was an unnecessary addition, my love."</p>
<p>"Well, so it was. Then the youngest sister explained to me, that
it was a song a Swiss peasant girl sang whilst she was milking her
cow; and I said that must be very difficult, to sing while milking
a cow. And then the mamma asked how I knew; and I said I had
<i>tried</i> very <i>often</i>."</p>
<p>"How could you, dear Lucy, volunteer such an avowal?"</p>
<p>"I thought you would be afraid of that; but it all did very
well, for the mother said I was so amusing, had so much natural
wit, and they all tried to persuade me I had said something
clever."</p>
<p>"Well, go on&mdash;and what then?"</p>
<p>"And then the lady took me aside, and began saying so much in
praise of you; and when she once got me on that subject, I was
ready and glib enough, I warrant you. But somehow, though I then
found it so much easier to speak, I find it more difficult to
recollect exactly what I said. Is not that strange? And then she
said that my happiness would excite so much envy in the great
world; that you had been admired, courted, nay, even loved by rich,
noble, clever ladies. Why was all this? and how could you ever
think to leave all these, to seek out from her quiet home your poor
little Lucy?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's a story of by-gone days. These were follies of my
youth, which I thought I had lived to repent.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'Nor knew, till seated by thy side,</p>
<p>My heart in all save hope the same.'"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Why, save hope, my dear Lord? What may you not only hope, but
trust, from my constant devotion?"</p>
<p>"I did not mean to tie myself precisely to every word I uttered.
It was only a quotation."</p>
<p>"And what is a quotation?"</p>
<p>"A quotation is the vehicle in which imagination posts forward,
when she only hires her Pegasus from memory. Or sometimes it is
only a quit-rent, which the intellectual cultivator, who farms an
idea, pays to the original proprietor; or rather,"&mdash;(seeing
that he was not making the matter more intelligible by his
explanation,)&mdash;"or rather, it is when we convey our own
thoughts by the means of the more perfect expressions of some
favourite author."</p>
<p>"But then, surely <i>you</i> need not be driven to borrow, whose
own words always sound to me like a book. As for poor me, I wish I
could talk in quotations for ever; then I need not fear to make
these mistakes, which, as it is, I am afraid I am always like to
do."</p>
<p>(A scene at <i>the Opera</i> is richer still: the performance
<i>Semiramide</i>:)</p>
<p>"Lady Gayland took the opportunity of inquiring of Lady
Castleton, 'how the opera had amused her?' There was that
unmistakable air of real interest in Lady Gayland's manner,
whenever she addressed Lucy, which made her always reply in a tone
of confidence, different <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295"
name="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span> from that which she felt towards
any other member of the society in which she moved.</p>
<p>"Why, to tell the honest truth," said she, leaning forwards
towards her questioner, "I can't say that I could the least
understand what it all meant. It's not likely that people should
sing when they're in such sorrow; and then I can't guess why that
young man should kill the queen that was so kind to him all
along."</p>
<p>"I don't wonder that that should surprise you, my dear; but he
was not aware of what he was doing. It was in the dark."</p>
<p>"In the dark! But I could see very well who it was, though I did
not know her so well as he did, and was so much farther off."</p>
<p>"I am afraid you are in the dark, too, a little as yet," said
Lady Gayland, (tapping her gently with her fan.) "But, tell me, did
you not admire the singing, though you could not understand the
story."</p>
<p>"Why, I should, perhaps, if I had known the language; but even
then they seemed to me more like birds, than men and women singing
words. I like a song that I can make out every word that's
said."</p>
<p>"The curtain then rose for the ballet; at first, Lucy was
delighted with the scenery and pageantry, for the spectacle was
grand and imposing. But at length the resounding plaudits announced
the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> of the perfect Taglioni. Lucy was a little
astonished at her costume upon her first appearance. She was
attired as a goddess, and goddesses' gowns are somewhat of the
shortest, and their legs rather <i>au naturel</i>; but when she
came to elicit universal admiration by pointing her toe, and
revolving in the slow <i>pirouette</i>, Lucy, from the situation in
which she sat was overpowered with shame at the effect; and whilst
Lady Gayland, with her <i>longnette</i> fixed on the stage,
ejaculated, 'Beautiful! inimitable!' the unpractised Lucy could not
help exclaiming, 'O that is too bad! I cannot stay to see that!'
and she turned her head away blushing deeply."</p>
<p>"Is your ladyship ill?" exclaimed Lord Stayinmore. "Castleton, I
am afraid Lady Castleton feels herself indisposed."</p>
<p>"Would you like to go?" kindly inquired Castleton.</p>
<p>"O so much!" she answered.</p>
<p>"Are you ill, my dear?" asked Lady Gayland.</p>
<p>"Oh, no!" she said.</p>
<p>"Then you had better stay, it is so beautiful."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lord Castleton is kind enough to let me go."</p>
<p>(They get into the carriage.)</p>
<p>"And how do you find yourself now, my dear Lucy?" tenderly
inquired Castleton, as the carriage drove off.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am quite well, thank you."</p>
<p>"Quite well! are you? What was it, then, that was the matter
with you?"</p>
<p>"There was nothing the matter with me, it was that woman."</p>
<p>"What woman? what can you mean? Did you not say that you were
ill; and was not that the reason that we hurried away?"</p>
<p>"No! YOU said I was ill; and I did not contradict you, because
you tell me that in the world, as you call it, it is not always
right to give the real reason for what we do; and therefore I
thought, perhaps, that though of course you wished me to come away,
you liked to put it upon my being ill."</p>
<p>"Of course I wished you to come away! I was never more unwilling
to move in all my life; and nothing but consideration for your
health would have induced me to stir. Why should I have wished you
to come away?"</p>
<p>"Why, the naked woman," stammered Lucy.</p>
<p>"What can you mean?"</p>
<p>"You couldn't surely wish me to sit by the side of those people,
to see such a thing as that?"</p>
<p>"As to being by the side of those people, I must remind you,
that it was Lady Gayland's box in which you were; and that whatever
she, with her acknowledged taste and refinement, sanctions with her
presence, can only be objected to by ignorance or prejudice. You
have still a great deal to learn, my dear Lucy," added he, more
kindly; "and nothing can be so fatal to your progress in that
respect, as your attempting to lead, or to find fault, with what
you do not understand."</p>
<p>"But surely I can understand that it is not right to do what I
saw that woman do," interrupted Lucy, presuming a little more
doggedly than she usually ventured to do on any subject with her
husband; for this time she had been really shocked by what she had
seen.</p>
<p>"Wrong it certainly is not, if you mean moral wrong. As to such
an exhibition being becoming or not in point of manners, that
depends entirely upon custom. Many things at your father's might
strike me as coarseness, which made no impression upon you from
habit, though much worse in my opinion than this presumed
indecorum. Those <span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name=
"page296"></a>[pg 296]</span> things probably arose from ignorance
on your parts, which might be corrected. This, on the other hand,
from conventional indifference, consequent on custom, which it is
not in you to correct. Depend upon it you will only get yourself
laughed at, and me too, if you preach about dancers'
petticoats."</p>
<p>"I don't want to preach to any body; and you know how much it
fashes me to contend with you."</p>
<p>"Don't say FASHES, say distresses, or annoys, not <i>fashes</i>,
for heaven's sake, my dear Lucy."</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, it was very stupid of me to forget it. That was one
of the first things you taught me, and it is a many days since I
said it last; but it is so strange to me to venture to differ with
you, that I get confused, and don't say any thing as right as I
could do. Even now I should like to ask, if modesty is a merit,
whether nakedness ought to be a show; but I'll say no more, for I
dare say you won't make me go there again."</p>
<p>"No, that will be the best way to settle it."</p>
<p>The plot of the Contrast is not, as the reader may perceive, one
of fashionable life: it has more of the romance of nature in its
composition: the characters are not the drawling bores that we find
in fashionable novels, though their affected freaks are
occasionally introduced to contrast with unsophisticated humility,
and thus exhibit the deformities of high life. The whole work is,
however, light as gossamer: we had almost said that a fly might
read it through the meshes, without endangering his patience or
liberty.</p>

<h3>THE LIBRARY OF ENTERTAINING KNOWLEDGE</h3>
<p>Maintains its rank in sober, we mean useful, literature. The
volume before us contains such matter as is only to be found in
large and expensive works, with a host of annotations from the
journals of recent travellers and other volumes which bear upon the
main subject. This part of the series, describing vegetable
substances used for the food of man, is executed with considerable
minuteness. A Pythagorean would gloat over its accuracy, and a
vegetable diet man would become inflated with its success in
establishing his eccentricities. The contents are the Corn-plants,
Esculent Roots, Herbs, Spices, Tea, Coffee, &amp;c. &amp;c. In such
a multiplicity of facts as the history of these plants must
necessarily include, some misstatements may be expected. For
example, the opinion that succory is superior to coffee, though
supported by Drs. Howison and Duncan, is not entitled to notice.
All over the continent, succory, or <i>chicor&eacute;e</i>, is used
to <i>adulterate</i> coffee, notwithstanding which a few scheming
persons have attempted to introduce it in this country as an
improvement, by selling it at four times its worth. Why say "it is
sometimes considered superior to the exotic berry," and in the same
page, "it is not likely to gain much esteem, where economy is not
the consideration." We looked in vain for mention of the President
of the Horticultural Society under Celery; though we never eat a
fine head of this delicious vegetable without grateful recollection
of Mr. T.A. Knight. All preachment of the economy of the Potato is
judiciously omitted, though we fear to the displeasure of Sir John
Sinclair; nor is there more space devoted to this overpraised root
than it deserves. Truffles are not only used "like mushrooms," but
for stuffing game and poultry, especially in France: who does not
remember the <i>perdrixaux truffes</i>, of the Parisian
<i>carte</i>. The chapter on coffee, cacao, tea, and sugar, is
brief but entertaining. We may observe, by the way, that one of the
obstacles to the profitable cultivation of tea in this country is
our ignorance of the modes of drying, &amp;c. as practised in
China.</p>
<p>Another volume of the Entertaining Series, published since that
just noticed, contains a selection of <i>Criminal Trials</i>,
amongst which are those of Throckmorton and the Duke of Norfolk,
for treason. They are, in the main, reprints from the State Trials,
which the professional editor states to contain a large fund of
instruction and <i>entertainment</i>. We have been deceived in the
latter quality, though we must admit that in judicious hands, a
volume of untiring interest might be wrought up from the State
records. As they are, their dulness and prolixity are past
endurance. As the present work proceeds in chronological order, it
will doubtless improve in its entertaining character, since no
class of literature has been more enriched by the publication of
journals, diaries, &amp;c., than historical biography, which will
thus enable the editor to enliven his pages with characteristic
traits of the principal actors. This has been done, to some extent,
in the portion before us, and in like manner fits the volume for
popular reading.</p>

<h3>FIRE TEMPLES IN PERSIA.</h3>
<div class="figure" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/546-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/546-2.png" alt=
"" /></a> Persian Temple</div>
<p>These mystical relics are but a short journey from the
celebrated ruins of Persepolis. Mr. Buckingham describes them in
his usual picturesque language: "Having several villages in sight,
as the sun rose, with cultivated land, flocks, trees, and water, we
arrived at the foot of the mountain, which forms the northern
boundary of the plain of Merdusht. The first object we saw on the
west was a small rock, on which stood two fire altars of a peculiar
form: their dimensions were five feet square at the base, and three
at the top, and they were five feet high. There were pillars or
pilasters at the corners, and arches in the sides. In the centre of
each of these, near the top, was a square basin, about eight inches
in diameter, and six in depth, for the reception of the fire,
formerly used by the disciples of Zoroaster in their worship."</p>
<p>Like Pythagoras, it may be here observed, Zoroaster, the
inventer of Magic, or the doctrines of the Magi, admitted no
visible object of devotion except fire, which he considered as the
most proper emblem of a supreme being; these doctrines seem to have
been preserved by Numa, in the worship and ceremonies which he
instituted in honour of Vesta. According to some of the moderns,
the doctrines, laws, and regulations of Zoroaster are still extant,
and they have been lately introduced in Europe, in a French
translation by M. Anquetil.</p>
<p>Mr. Buckingham notices an existing custom, which he attributes
to this reverence to fire. "Throughout all Persia, a custom
prevails of giving the salute 'Salami Alaikom,' whenever the first
lighted lamp or candle is brought into the room in the evening; and
this is done between servants and masters as well as between
equals. As this is not practised in any other Mahommedan country,
it is probably a relic of the ancient reverence to fire, once so
prevalent here, though the form of the salute is naturally that of
the present religion."</p>

<h2>THE NATURALIST.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>WHALE CHASE.</h3>
<p>A Scottish journal, the <i>Caledonian Mercury</i>, describes the
following animated scene, which lately took place off the town of
Stornoway, in the island of Lewis. An immense shoal of whales was,
early in the morning, chased to the mouth of the harbour by two
fishing-boats, which had met them in the offing.</p>
<p>"The circumstance was immediately descried from the shore, and a
host of boats, amounting to 30 or 40, and armed with every species
of weapon, set off to join the others in pursuit. The chase soon
became one of bustle and anxiety on the part both of man and fish.
The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>[pg
298]</span> boats arranged themselves in the form of a crescent, in
the fold of which the whales were collected, and where they had to
encounter incessant showers of stones, splashing of oars, with
frequent gashes from a harpoon or spear, while the din created by
the shouts of the boats' crews and the multitude on shore, was
tremendous. On more than one occasion, however, the floating
phalanx was broken, and it required the greatest activity and tact
ere the breach could be repaired and possession of the fugitives
regained. The shore was neared by degrees, the boats advancing and
retreating by turns, till at length they succeeded in driving the
captive monsters on a beach opposite to the town, and within a few
yards of it. The gambols of the whales were now highly diverting,
and, except when a fish became unmanageable and enraged while the
harpoon was fixed, or the noose of a rope pulled tight round its
tail, they were not at all dangerous to be approached. In the
course of a few hours the capture was complete, the shore was
strewed with their dead carcases, while the sea presented a bloody
and troubled aspect, giving evident proofs that it was with no
small effort they were subdued. For fear of contagion, the whole
fish amounting to ninety-eight, some of them very large, were
immediately towed to a spot distant from the town, where they were
on Thursday sold by public roup, the proceeds to be divided among
the captors. An annual visit is generally paid by the whales to the
Lewis coast, and besides being profitable when caught, they
generally furnish a source of considerable amusement. On the
present occasion, the whole inhabitants of the place, male and
female, repaired to the beach, opposite to the scene of slaughter,
where they evidently were delighted spectators, and occasionally
gave assistance. A young sailor received a stroke from the tail of
one of the largest fish, which nearly killed him."</p>
<hr />
<h3>AUDUBON.</h3>
<p>The Philadelphia journals communicate some particulars of the
journey of this enterprising naturalist into E. Florida. He has
discovered, shot, and drawn a new Ibis, which he has named
<i>Tantalus fuscus</i>. In a letter, he says</p>
<p>"I have discovered three different new species of Heath, one
bearing a yellow blossom, the two others a red and purple
one;&mdash;also, a beautiful new Kalmia, and several extraordinary
parasitical plants, bearing some resemblance to the pineapple
plant, growing on the <i>eastern</i> side of the cyprus tree in
swamps, about 6 or 10 feet above the water.</p>
<p>"During my late excursion I almost became an amphibious
being&mdash;spending the most of my days in the water, and by night
pitching my tent on the barren sands. Whilst I remained at Spring
Garden, the alligators were yet in full life; the white-headed
eagles setting; the smaller resident birds paring; and strange to
say, the warblers which migrate, moving easterly every warm day,
and returning every cold day, a curious circumstance, tending to
illustrate certain principles in natural economy."</p>
<p>Six boxes of prepared skins of birds, &amp;c. as well as a
number of choice shells, seeds, roots, &amp;c. the result of
Audubon's researches, have been received in Charleston.</p>
<p>"In this collection there are between four and five hundred
skins of Birds, several of them rare in this part of the United
States&mdash;some that are never found here, and a few that have
not yet been described. Of these are two of the species of Pelican
(Pelicanus) not described by Wilson. The Parrot (psittacus
Carolinensis); the palm warbler of Buonaparte (Silvia palmerea),
and the Florida Jay, a beautiful bird without the crest, so common
in that genus.</p>
<p>"Among the new discoveries of Audubon in Florida, we perceive a
noble bird partaking of the appearance both of the Falcon and
Vulture tribes, which would seem to be a connecting link between
the two. His habits too, it is said, partake of his appearance, he
being alternately a bird of prey, and feeding on the same food with
the Vultures. This bird remains yet to be described, and will add
not only a new species, but a new genus to the birds of the United
States. We perceive also in Mr. Audubon's collection, a new species
of Coot (Fulica).<a id="footnotetag9" name=

<h3>REMARKABLE JAY.</h3>
<p>A lady residing at Blackheath has in her possession a fine Jay,
which displays instinct allied to reason and reflection in no
ordinary degree. This bird is stated by a Correspondent, (A.T.) to
repeat distinctly any word that may be uttered before. She can
identify persons after having once seen them, and been told their
names; the latter she will pronounce with surprising clearness. She
has a strong affection for a goldfinch in the same apartment, the
latter bird appearing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name=
"page299"></a>[pg 299]</span> to return this fondness by fluttering
its wings and other demonstrations of delight. The Jay has also
been seen playing with two kittens, while the old cat looked
composedly on at their gambols. This bird is in beautiful plumage,
and is about twenty years of age. She is well known to the
residents of Blackheath and its vicinity.</p>

<h3>ENTOMOLOGY.</h3>
<p>I have lately observed a curious fact, which I have never seen
noticed in any book which has fallen in my way, viz. that it is the
tail of the caterpillar which becomes the head of the butterfly. I
found it hard to believe till I had convinced myself of it in a
number of instances. The caterpillar weaves its web from its mouth,
finishes with the head downwards, and the head, with the six front
legs, are thrown off from the chrysalis, and may be found dried up,
but quite distinguishable, at the bottom of the web. The butterfly
comes out at the top. Is this fact generally
known?&mdash;<i>Corresp. Mag. Nat. Hist.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>THE RIVER TINTO.</h3>
<p>The river Tinto rises in Sierra Morena, and empties itself into
the Mediterranean, near Huelva, having the name of Tinto given it
from the tinge of its waters, which are as yellow as a topaz,
hardening the sand and petrifying it in a most surprising manner.
If a stone happen to fall in, and rest on another, they both become
in a year's time perfectly united and conglutiated. This river
withers all the plants on its banks, as well as the roots of trees,
which it dyes of the same hue as its waters. No kind of verdure
will flourish where it reaches, nor any fish live in its stream. It
kills worms in cattle, when given them to drink; but in general no
animals will drink out of the river, except goats, whose flesh,
nevertheless, has an excellent flavour. These singular properties
continue till other rivulets run into it, and alter its nature; for
when it passes by Niebla, it is not different from other rivers. It
falls into the Mediterranean six leagues lower down, at the town of
Huelva, where it is two leagues broad, and admits of large vessels,
which may come up the river as high as San Juan del Puerto, three
leagues above Huelva.&mdash;<i>From a Correspondent.</i></p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS</h2>
<hr />
<h3>THE GALLEY SLAVES.</h3>
<p>About a mile distant from one of the southern barriers of Paris,
a palace was built during <i>our</i> Henry the Sixth's brief and
precarious possession of French royalty, by the Bishop of
Winchester. It was known by the name of Winchester, of which,
however, the French kept continually clipping and changing the
consonants, until the Anglo-Saxon Winchester dwindled into the
French appellation of Bic&ecirc;tre. The Bishop's old palace was
treated as unceremoniously as his name, being burnt in some of the
civil wars. But there is this advantage in a sumptuous edifice,
that its very ruins suggest the thought and supply the means of
rebuilding it. Bic&ecirc;tre, accordingly, reared its head, and is
now a straggling mass of building, containing a mad-house, a
poor-house, an hospital, and a prison.</p>
<p>To see it is a matter of trifling difficulty, except on one
particular day&mdash;that devoted to the rivetting of the
<i>chaine</i>. A surgeon, however, belonging to the establishment,
promised to procure me admission, and on receiving his summons, I
started one forenoon for Bic&ecirc;tre. Mortifying news awaited my
arrival. The convicts had plotted a general insurrection and
escape, which was to have taken place on the preceding night. It
had been discovered in time, however, and such precautions taken,
as completely prevented even the attempt. The chief of these
precautions appeared in half a regiment of troops, that had
bivouacked all night in the square adjoining the prison, and were
still some lying, some loitering about. Strict orders had been
issued, that no strangers should be admitted to witness the
ceremony of rivetting; and the turnkeys and gaolers, in appearance
not yet recovered from the alarm of the preceding evening, refused
to listen to either bribe, menace, or solicitation. It was
confoundedly vexatious. Whilst expostulating with the turnkey, I
caught a glimpse through a barred window of the interior court,
athwart which the chains lay extended, whilst in one railed off
even from this the convicts were crowded, marching round and
round&mdash;precaution forbade their remaining still&mdash;and
uttering from time to time such yells and imprecations as might
deafen and appal a Mohawk. "I have caught a glimpse at least,"
thought I, as we were unceremoniously turned out.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>[pg
300]</span>
<p>My friend, the surgeon, bade us, however, not despair. When the
man of influence arrived he hoped to prevail; and in the mean time
he led us to view the other curiosities of Bic&ecirc;tre. There was
the well, the kitchen, the anatomical theatre. The courts were
crowded with aged paupers, who each well knew that his carcass
would undergo what laceration the scalpel of my friend and his
comrades chose to inflict upon it. But the thought seemed not to
affect them so much as it did us. Methought the business of
dissecting dead subjects might have been carried on more remote
from the living candidates; but I was wrong, for mystery and
secrecy always beget fear.</p>
<p>The mad-house was another curiosity. It contains many whose
brain the revolution of July, 1830, had turned. One man, a fine
youth, had travelled on foot from a distant part of the kingdom, to
shed his blood as a sacrifice to the memory of Napoleon. He gave
his last franc to obtain admission within the pillar of the Place
Vend&ocirc;me, and when there opened the veins of both his arms,
crying out, "I offer the blood of the brave to the manes of
Napoleon." His rolling black eye was now contrasted with a face
pale as death. He had lost so much blood that few hopes were
entertained of his recovery.</p>
<p>But by far the most curious patient of the mad-house, was a
young man who imagined himself to be a woman. He was handsome, but
not feminine in appearance. He adored a little mirror, with which
he was gratified. Rags of all colours were his delight; and he had
made a precious collection. His coquetry was evident; and he
answered pertinently all questions, never belying at the same time
his fixed opinion, that he was endowed with a maiden's charms.</p>
<p>We looked over the book of reports, and found seven-eighths of
the female patients to have become deranged from love; whilst, with
the majority of the males, the hallucination proceeded from
disappointments of ambition. Surprised, I could make out no case of
a religious maniac; glad, I could discover none of a student.</p>
<p>We now returned to machinations for the purpose of entering the
forbidden prison. Aprons were handed us, not unlike a barber's.
They were surgeons' aprons, always worn by those of the
establishment when on duty. Might not then the barbers' aprons be a
tradition of the barber-surgeons? I refrained from asking the
question in that company. The scheme was, that we should pass for
<i>Carabins</i>&mdash;such is the nickname of French students in
chirurgery&mdash;and in this quality demand admission. The Cerberus
of the prison grinned at the deceit, but wearied and amused by our
importunities, he actually opened the <i>quicket</i> and admitted
us. There are two grated doors of this kind, one always locked
whilst the other is opened. In an instant we were in
Pandemonium.</p>
<p>The buildings, which surrounded and formed the courts, evidently
the oldest and strongest of Bic&ecirc;tre, harmonized in dinginess
with the scene. At every barred window, and these were numerous,
about a dozen ruffianly heads were thrust together, to regard the
chains of their companions.&mdash;What a study of physiognomy! The
murderer's scowl was there, by the side of the laughing countenance
of the vagabond, whose shouts and jokes formed a kind of tenor to
the muttered imprecations of the other. Here and there was
protruded the fine, open, high-fronted head,&mdash;pale, striking,
features, and dark looks, of some felon of intellect and natural
superiority; whilst by his side, ignominy looked stupidly and
maliciously on. A handsome little fellow at one of the grates, was
dressing his hair unconsciously with most agitated fingers,
evidently affected by the scene. Our question of "What are you in
for?" aroused him. "False signing a billet of twenty thousand
francs," replied he, with a shrug and a smile. "And he, your
neighbour?" asked we cautiously, concerning one of a fine,
thoughtful, philosophic, and passionate countenance. "Ha! you may
ask&mdash;he gave his mistress a potion, for the purpose of merely
seducing her, and it turned out to be poison&mdash;a <i>carabin</i>
like yourselves." But these made no part of the <i>chaine</i>.</p>
<p>The convicts destined for this operation were kept in movement
round a post in an adjoining court, and were shouting, rarely in
intelligible language, to their companions. Joy was the universal
tone, and a sniveller ran imminent danger. One poor fellow I
remarked holding down his head, when he was saluted with a kick
from him who followed, and the objurgation, <i>Tu es for&ccedil;at,
toi, heim?</i>&mdash;"You a convict, and durst be sad." These men
were all unmanacled. Methought a general rush on their part both
practicable and formidable. One half must have perished, and the
other half might have escaped.</p>
<p>They were now marched out from the inner court in batches of
thirty at a time, drawn up in rank, stripped, and examined
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>[pg
301]</span> with such rigid scrutiny as I dare not precise. They
were then marched and placed along one of the extended chains, and
made to sit down, resting it in their laps. A square fetter was
then fitted and placed around the neck of each. In this, before,
some detached links from the chain were placed, whilst a huge smith
proceeded to rivet each from behind. Fixing a kind of movable anvil
behind the convict's back, the fetter that encircled his neck was
brought with its joint upon it, and half a dozen blows of the
sledge riveted the captive inextricably to the main chain and to
his twenty-nine comrades. The smith must be adroit at his task, and
the convict steady in his position; for, as the fetter is tight
round the neck, the hammer, in its blow, must pass within a quarter
of an inch of his skull, and a wince on his part might prove fatal.
This, indeed, is the trying moment, when the stoutest cheek is
blanched. The sturdiest frame, shaken by the blows of the sledge,
then betrays emotion, and tears of penitence are at that moment
almost always seen to fall. On sitting down, each had in general an
air of bravado, produced in a great measure by the regards of the
seemingly more hardened ruffians from the windows. Under the
riveting there was no smile; whilst after it, apathy was affected
or resumed, each endeavouring to make his iron collar as
supportable and comfortable as possible, by enveloping it in a
handkerchief, and guaranteeing the neck from its chill or
galling.</p>
<p>When the <i>chaine</i> was completed, its wearers were made to
stand up. They formed themselves in couples, the chain running
betwixt two ranks, and they walked round the yard to take their
first lesson in their galling exercise. They are thus fettered
together till they reach Brest or Toulon. The choice is left to
them of walking or being carried in carts, more provender being
given to those who make the journey on foot.</p>
<p>The only part of their habiliments, which seemed left to
themselves to provide, was a covering for the head, the red or
green cap being given them only upon entering the <i>bagne</i>. For
their journey, some of the fellows had provided themselves with
strange head-gear, mostly made of straw; one had a three-cocked
hat; others, one of all kinds of <i>outr&eacute;</i> shapes. A
prime vagabond had woven for himself a complete and magnificent
tiara, precisely like the Roman Pontiff's in form, and surmounted
by a cross. This was the <i>Pope</i>, the Pope of the
<i>Chaine</i>, and I never heard a shout so appalling, as that with
which his appearance was welcomed by the prisoners from the windows
of the building. They danced, they yelled, tore and tumbled over
each other in the most exuberant delight, thrusting their crowded
heads and distorted features almost through the gratings. I have
gleaned from it quite an idea of a scene of merriment and
exultation <i>below</i>.</p>
<p>The said Pope was a very extraordinary fellow: a slight fair
form, pointed features, and eyes that were penetrating, despite
their common shade of grey. He was called <i>Champenois</i>, his
real name unknown, not more than three-and-twenty, and the
Lieutenant of the <i>Chaine</i> said, one of the most talented and
extraordinary characters that <i>he</i> had ever met with. He had
been the prime mover of the intended insurrection, but without a
proof against him, except his universal authority, unusual in so
young a thief. His physiognomy was one, which it required not a
second look in order to remember for ever.</p>
<p>Another figure struck me, not so much as singular in itself, as
in contrast with those around. It struck me as that of an English
cabin-boy, a pale, freckled, ill-conditioned lad. On following the
calling over of the register in roll, I found my conjecture too
true. He was an unfortunate young sailor, a native of England,
guilty of some misdemeanour, and by name Aikin. He understood not a
word of French, but protested with a shake of his head against his
being English; patriotism had in him outlived honesty and
self-respect. I spoke to him in English: he wept, but would not
reply, puckering up his poor lips in all the agony of his desolate
condition. I was glad to remark the humanity with which he had been
chained to a prisoner, pensive and downcast like himself.</p>
<p>There were some cases certainly hard; one or two for resisting
the <i>gen-d'armerie</i> in a riot at Rouen. To transport a rioter,
unless under aggravated circumstances, is grievous enough; but
after the revolution of July, that hallowed riot, to make a
galley-slave of a <i>brave</i> for resisting the police, must have
been at least surprising to him. The tribunal no doubt felt the
necessity of severity; and we acknowledged it all in deploring the
degradation of these poor devils for an act, which in so many
thousand others was, at the moment, extolled to the skies as the
acm&eacute; of heroism. But justice hath her lottery-wheel as well
as fortune.</p>
<p>As the last <i>chaine</i> was completing, an <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span>
ecclesiastic went round to collect money of the visitors. But as
there were few, so were the offerings. The convicts at the same
time produced the fruits of their ingenuity in straw work-boxes,
needle-cases, carved ivory and wood. The guardians, to do them
justice, seemed humane.</p>
<p>The <i>bagne</i> at Toulon, the destination of the members of
the <i>chaine</i>, was respectably peopled when I visited it some
years ago. It contained amongst others, Sarrazin, a famous general,
who had deserted to us from Buonaparte, and whose works on the
Spanish and other campaigns, are still read with interest. The
general had caught the inexcusable habit of marrying a wife in each
town wherein he was quartered, and was sent to the gallies for
<i>trigintagamy</i>. They boasted a bishop too amongst the convicts
at Toulon, a merry little fellow, that bore his fate gaily, and who
still contrived to exercise a kind of spiritual supremacy over his
unfortunate comrades.</p>
<p>The ingenuity and hardihood of these men is surprising. Despite
the vigilance, the ramparts, the fetters, and the logs, they escape
hourly and daily;&mdash;at what risk is manifest from the
regulations, by which three cannon shots always announce the
disappearance of a convict, serving to warn the peasants, and call
them to earn the handsome reward given to whoever arrests one of
the branded fugitives. They are easily recognised by the halt in
one limb; as they are wont to drag after them that which has been
accustomed to the bullet.</p>
<p>The only pursuits that seem to pervade the <i>bagne</i>, are
those of <i>eating</i> and <i>dying</i>: with the exception of
escape, all others are denied. And those who have given up the
latter hope, confine their thoughts either to bettering their
meagre fare of beans, or to getting rid of existence in the most
advantageous way. It is remarkable and degrading to observe the
utmost human ingenuity and industry employed, in order to procure a
dish of potatoes fried in grease once in the week. Yet such is the
luxury of a <i>for&ccedil;at</i>, and he must labour for it harder
than even an Hibernian peasant, or a poet of the same line.</p>
<p>The more philosophic, who scorn the luxury of potatoes, and with
it the life that affords no other, meditate how best to get rid of
existence; and this they effect almost ever in one way; viz., by
killing their most obnoxious keeper, and thus earning the
guillotine.</p>
<p>It is a frequent scene in the <i>bagne</i>, that of an
execution. It occurs every week or fortnight. All the convicts are
obliged to attend, for the purpose of striking them with terror,
and working contrition and good behaviour in them. Alas! it is a
huge mistake. For these days are of all other days of
<i>f&ecirc;te</i> to them. Their countenances are marked by
universal joy, and they shout congratulations, not condolences, to
their comrade about to perish. Death to them is indeed an escape.
Its ceremony is to them a marriage feast: and decapitation, what a
<i>black job</i> was to Lord Portsmouth,&mdash;the only variety and
excitement that could give a spur to their heavy and painful
existence.</p>
<p>Speak as we may against the pains of death, this is worse, not
only physically but morally; for it degrades humanity far lower
than is conceiveable. The French have an idea that they can imitate
the American mode of punishment by solitary confinement. This again
will be still worse than the galleys; since religious consolation
can alone redeem or ameliorate man in this state of durance; and as
this makes no part of the French system, I cannot help thinking the
<i>guillotine</i> more merciful, than either their <i>bagne</i> or
their solitary cells.&mdash;<i>Monthly Magazine.</i></p>

<h2>THE GATHERER.</h2>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Johnson has remarked that the French are fond of Young's
<i>Night Thoughts</i>, a fact which is hard to be accounted for,
that a nation so celebrated for their gaiety should have a regard
for an author treating on such serious subjects.</p>
<p><i>Wigs</i>.&mdash;In the reign of Queen Anne, enormous
full-bottomed wigs often cost twenty or thirty guineas each.</p>
<p>"<i>Capillary Attraction</i>."&mdash;When Charles II. was
espoused to the Infanta of Portugal, a fleet was sent over to
Lisbon, with proper attendants to bring her hither, but her majesty
being informed that there were some particular customs in Portugal,
with relation to the ladies, which the king would not easily
dispense with, the fleet was detained six or seven weeks, at a
great expense, till <i>her majesty's hair grew</i>.</p>
<p>(Mr. Prince, with his Russia Oil, would have prospered under
Royal Patronage in those days; and Mr. Rowland would not have
needed immortality in Byron's verse: "incomparable <i>huile
Macassar</i>.")</p>
<p><i>The King of Kippen.</i>&mdash;When James V. of Scotland,
travelled in disguise, he used a name which was known only to some
of the principal nobility and attendants. He was called the Goodman
(the tenant, that is) of Ballangiech. Ballangiech is a steep pass,
which leads down behind the Castle of Stirling. Once, when he was
feasting in Stirling, the king sent for some venison from the
neighbouring hills. The deer were killed and put on horses' backs
to be transported to Stirling. Unluckily, they had to pass the
castle gates of Ampryor, belonging to a chief of the Buchanans, who
had a considerable number of guests with him. It was late, and the
company were rather short of victuals, though they had more than
enough of liquor. The chief, seeing so much fat venison passing his
very door, seized on it; and, to the expostulations of the keepers,
who told him that it belonged to King James, he answered
insolently, that if James was king in Scotland, he, Buchanan, was
king in Kippen, being the name of the district in which the Castle
of Ampryor lay. On hearing what had happened, the king got on
horseback, and rode instantly from Stirling to Buchanan's house,
where he found a strong, fierce-looking Highlander, with an axe on
his shoulder, standing sentinel at the door. This grim warder
refused the king admittance, saying that "the Laird of Arnpryor was
at dinner, and would not be disturbed." "Yet go up to the company,
my good friend," said the king, "and tell him that the good man of
Ballangiech is come to feast with the King of Kippen." The porter
went grumbling into the house, and told his master that there was a
fellow with a red beard who called himself the good man of
Ballangiech, at the gate, and said he was come to dine with the
King of Kippen. As soon as Buchanan heard these words, he knew that
the king was there in person, and hastened down to kneel at James's
feet, and to ask forgiveness for his insolent behavour. But the
king, who only meant to give him a fright, forgave him freely, and,
going into the castle, feasted on his own venison, which Buchanan
had intercepted. Buchanan of Arnpryor was ever afterwards called
King of Kippen.</p>

<p><i>Remarkable Murder</i>.&mdash;"Anno 1605: one William
Calverly, of Calverly, in the county of York, esquire, murthered
two of his own children at home at his own house, then stabbed his
wife into the body, with full intent to have killed her, and then
went out with intention to have killed his child, at nurse, but was
prevented. He was pressed to death, at York, for this murther,
because he stood mute, and would not plead."&mdash;<i>Old

of three-farthings for every day's neglect; excepting <i>Maids,

appellation of the King Maker. His biographer says, "He was a man
whose hospitality was so abundant, that the ordinary consumption of
a breakfast, at his house in London, was six oxen; whose popularity
was so great, that his absence was accounted as the absence of the
sun from the hemisphere; whose service was so courted, that men of
all <span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>[pg

<p>This implement was known to the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans,
and was invented at a very early period, being perhaps nearly
coeval with the cultivation of the soil itself. Anciently, the
tenants (in England) in some manors, were not allowed to have their
rural implements sharpened by any but those whom the lord
appointed; for which an acknowledgment was to be paid, called
<i>agusa dura</i>; in some places <i>agusage</i>, a fee for
sharpening plough-tackle, which some take to be the same with what
was otherwise called <i>reillage</i>, from the ancient French
<i>reille</i>, a <i>ploughshare</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ancient F&ecirc;te at Gorhamlury.</i>&mdash;In the year 1577,
Queen Elizabeth was entertained at Gorhambury, by Sir Nicholas
Bacon, Lord Keeper, from Saturday, May the 18th, to the Wednesday
following, at the expense of 577<i>l</i>. 6<i>s</i>. 7-1/4<i>d</i>.
besides fifteen bucks and two stags. Among the dainties of the
feathered kind, enumerated in this entertainment, Mr. Nichols
mentions herons, bitterns, godwites, dotterels, shovelers, curlews,
and knots. Sir Nicholas Bacon was frequently visited by the queen,
who dated many of her state papers from Gorhambury.</p>

<p><i>Adrian the Fourth.</i>&mdash;Adrian the Fourth was the only
Englishman who ever filled the Papal chair. His name was Nicholas
Breakspeare, and he was born at Abbot's Langley, a village in
Herts. Such was the unbounded pride of this pontiff, that when the
Emperor Frederick the First went to Rome, in 1155, to receive the
imperial diadem, the Pope, after many difficulties concerning the
ceremonial of investiture, insisted that the emperor should
prostrate himself before him, kiss his feet, hold his stirrup, and
lead the white palfrey on which the holy father rode. Frederick did
not submit to this humiliation without reluctance; and as he took
hold of the stirrup, he observed that "he had not yet been taught
the profession of a groom." In a letter to his old friend, John of
Salisbury, he says that St. Peter's Chair was the most uneasy seat
in the world, and that his crown seemed to be clapped burning on
his head. Yet did this haughty Pope (according to Dr. Cave) allow
his mother to be maintained by the alms of the church of
Canterbury.</p>
<p>P.T.W.</p>
<p><i>Quid pro quo.</i>&mdash;A peasant of Burgundy, whom Louis XI.
had taken some notice of, while Dauphin, appeared before him when
he ascended the throne, and presented him with an extraordinary
large radish; Louis received it with much goodwill, and handsomely
repaid the peasant. The great man of the place, to whom the
countryman related his good fortune, imagined that if he were to
offer Louis something, he would, at any rate, make him a prince.
Accordingly he went to court, and presented his finest horse to the
king. Louis received his present as graciously as he had before
taken the radish, and after he had sufficiently praised the horse,
"See here," said he, taking the radish in his hand, "here is a
radish, which, like your horse, is one of the rarest of its kind; I
present it to you with many thanks."</p>

<p><i>Muswell Hill</i> derives its name from a famous well on the
hill, where, formerly, the fraternity of St. John of Jerusalem, in
Clerkenwell, had their dairy, with a large farm adjacent. Here they
built a chapel for the benefit of some nuns, in which they fixed
the image of our Lady of Muswell. These nuns had the sole
management of the dairy: and it is singular, that the said well and
farm do, at this time, belong to the parish of St. James,
Clerkenwell. The water of this spring was then deemed a miraculous
cure for scrofulous and cutaneous disorders. For that reason it was
much resorted to; and, as tradition says, a king of Scotland made a
pilgrimage hither, and was perfectly cured.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
